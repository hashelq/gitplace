# THE GIT PLACE
This is a repository that aims to provide a library of user submitted articles/manuals for computing.

This repository is fully open to people to share their articles, links to content, etc.

# Articles
Articles are free (libre) and open source.
Other people can contribute to it, to make your life easier.
When you create an article, you don't need to specify any nickname or something, it is already shown that you have create this file in git logs.

The article should be stored in the .md format and have an appropriate structure.
The name of the file must simply describe itself like **How to install archlinux**
If your article is complex and has additional files, please move create a directory with the name of the article,
and store your .md file with the same name and other files there.
Like here: [https://github.com/hashelq/gitplace/tree/master/articles/complex-example](complex-example) 

# Contributing
Please note, that we only accept files that ONLY include human-readable text (md, json, etc).
If the file is too bloat (like .html) or contains hard-coded images, it will be denied.

To sumbit something of any kind, you need to understand how people should find it.
For now, there are 3 directories, where you can put your data:
1) [https://github.com/hashelq/gitplace/tree/master/articles](Articles) - You go there and select/create an appropriate category (like SEC that stands for security)
2) [https://github.com/hashelq/gitplace/tree/master/place](Place) - scripts/manuals/configs related for maintaining this repository.
3) [https://github.com/hashelq/gitplace/tree/master/other](Other) - everything else, like .json lists of cool websites, single configs, etc.

Note, that there are other directories (like [https://github.com/hashelq/gitplace/tree/master/.secret](.secret)) that can also be modified if you wish it.
But you don't need to modify it, I think.

If you want to change the structure, please create an issue and discuss it.
